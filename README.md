It's an application/project builder from prebuilt structures. You can use smaller blocks to build your application
dynamically (generate source code and all other stuff). There are high-level Java templates for building the whole
project. For instance, micro-service template is for building new micro-service with known architecture. It possible
to use your own abstract types with the template or build your own template.
